## Welcome to Between The Turns!

This is our very first episode, and we're excited to have you here.

### What is Between The Turns?

Between The Turns is a podcast that captures those magical moments of conversation that happen when you're playing board games. You know those moments - when you're waiting for your turn, when someone's taking a bit longer to strategize, or when a move sparks an unexpected tangent.

### The Format

Each episode features:
- **A board game** - Sometimes familiar classics, sometimes new discoveries
- **Interesting guests** - Creative, technical, fun, and diverse people
- **Real conversations** - Unscripted, authentic discussions
- **Under 30 minutes** - Respecting your time while delivering value

### Why Board Games?

Board games create a unique environment for conversation:

1. **Natural rhythm** - The turn-based nature creates space for thoughts to develop
2. **Shared activity** - Everyone has something to do, reducing awkwardness
3. **Unexpected connections** - Game events often spark surprising discussion topics
4. **Relaxed atmosphere** - Play puts people at ease

### What's Coming

In future episodes, we'll be featuring:
- Entrepreneurs and creators
- Artists and designers
- Tech professionals
- Community builders
- And many more interesting folks!
